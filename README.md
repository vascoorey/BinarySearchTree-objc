BinarySearchTree
================

Straightforward implementation from Algorithms, 4th Edition (p396)

Still needs testing (hence the 0.0.1) tag

TODO
====

* Take care of the case where the keys are of different classes (this shouldn't really be happening in a BST)
* Write unit tests
* Analyze performance
* And much more
